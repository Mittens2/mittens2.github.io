    <h3>18 miles hiked, Mile 141</h3>

    I wake up, still in the fog. I make some cold oatmeal and pack up. As soon as I start walking, my knee feels awful. I pushed it too hard too quickly, and am paying for it. I climb a bit more, and reach the campsite that I had aimed at reaching the day before – a little camp among the boulders. I see Cheswick and another hiker named Patrick, both of whom I had met under the bridge at Scissor’s Crossing. I trudge on, beginning to descend the mountain I climbed yesterday. I’m having to take a break every couple of miles to roll out my IT band with my pole – pain time is not nearly as fun when it’s just you.
    <br><br>
    I decide to try and drown out the pain with some music, and put on DAMN by Kendrick Lamar. I find myself on a mountain road, intersecting the two green mountains which the trail wanders along. I am running low on water, and am glad to see a sign pointing me to “Mike's Place”. I head down the road, and refill at a water tank. I’ve heard pretty mixed reviews about Mike’s Place, and with the pain I’m feeling decide to hike on to make some miles.
    <br><br>
     I keep walking, and am caught by Cheswick and Patrick. We take a break together at a campsite. It’s kind of chilly, so I pull out my toque. The fact that I call it a toque and not a beanie makes Cheswick and Patrick roar in laughter (which in retrospect doesn't make sense because Patrick is from Quebec). Patrick and Cheswick decide that my trail name should be toque. They also tell me that they’ve thought of a trail name for Patrick – Socrepes, because he's a deep thinker like Socrates, but also French (and more hiker trashy). Cheswick and Patrick leave before me. I look down and see that Cheswick left his rolling tobacco behind, so I pick it up in case I catch him.
     <br><br>
    A couple of minutes later, Tink, Possum, and Birdie catch me. I hike with them for about a mile or so before we take a smoke break. Tink and Birdie tell me that Possum’s written an awesome song, and get him hyped so he'll sing to us. Possum finally obliges them - the song is about Miller Draft. We keep walking, but I’m having a hard time keeping up because of my knee. I take lunch a little bit later, as the others hike on. Somehow I’m still making miles having covered 12 miles.
    <br><br>
     I walk on and see my first 3 snakes of the trail. No rattlesnakes yet - all garter snakes or racers, hard to tell. The sun starts to do its afternoon thing, making the desert shadows tilt in it’s orangey glow. I start craving some music again - specifically Bombay Bicycle Club's first album. I listen to it and am reminded of my friends in Toronto. On “Cancel on Me” I cry a bit – perhaps a bit of homesickness.
     <br><br>
     I pass by Cheswick and Socrepes. They're hiding from the sun in Cheswick’s Nemo Hornet. I  hand Cheswick his bag of rolling tobacco, and keep walking to the next water source. The water source is a weird penny coloured spring that has a pretty gnarly hill leading down to it. Tink, Possum, and Birdie are hanging out at the top, saying they couldn’t find a way down. The next water source is far, and I’m bone dry. I look around, but can’t find a nice access to the water either. I remember what I had read in Carlie’s, and what's become a bit of a theme for my thru-hike - overcoming fears. I decide to run down a steep wash, which ends up being not too sketchy. The water tastes terrible – the worst tasting water on trail (thus far), but the effort is worth it to stay hydrated.

    I keep walking until I get to a campsite in a dry river bed. I think to myself that I'll make dinner here and then keep hiking. After dinner, I hike about a quarter mile uphill, before deciding to call it quits. I pick a very windy spot to camp, overlooking the dry river below. I devise a way to set up my tent despite the strong wind. It's still early so I pop in my headphones and listen to the last few episodes of Serial. By 8:30 I'm totally drained and call it a night. I drift off into a deep sleep.
