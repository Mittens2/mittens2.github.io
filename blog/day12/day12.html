     I wake up in the bed beside Carlie. We make breakfast in our room. We’ve all decided to zero – spend a day not hiking at all. This gives me time to rest my knee, do groceries, and get a bit of a feel for town. After breakfast, we do sink laundry in our bathroom. Even after many rinses, my clothes still leave the water in the sink brown.
     <br><br>
     Once our clothes, have been deemed clean enough, we finally head out on the town. Jordan and I head to the outdoor store, while Carlie and Hannah head out in search of a store that sells crafts. I started the trail with two pairs of socks, and I’ve already walked through one. I pick up a pair of Darn Toughs at the store. I also query one of the store employees about snow conditions on Mt. San Jacinto. Prior to beginning the trail, there were many posts on the PCT Facebook group that saying that we would need our ice axe and micro-spikes for the ascent of Mt. San Jacinto and Mt. Baden Powell - the two tallest peaks which the PCT traverses in the desert. In a normal snow year, this would be unheard of, but because California had one of its snowiest winters in recent history, the snow is lingering where it woudln't otherwise be a concern. To my delight, the employee assures me that the snow on both peaks has significantly subsided, and that I won’t be requiring my snow gear. This is a huge weight of my back - literally, it means I can ship my snow gear ahead to Kennedy Meadows.

     I go outside and make a call to my parents while Jordan finishes her shopping. We meet up with Hannah and Carlie, and head to the café for a morning coffee. At the café we make plans for the upcoming day. We decide that we’ll have a chill night in at the other hotel in town. We head to a video rental store to pick up a DVD. The K-mart is right across the parking lot from the video store, so I head to resupply while Carlie gets a haircut at the barber shop next door. We then head to the Silver Pines Inn, and drop off our bags in our room, taking a quick nap. In the afternoon, I bounce my gear box which contains my micro-spikes to Kennedy Meadows, feeling a little bit of nervousness sending my snow stuff that far up ahead, but also feeling good that I won’t have to add more weight to my bag.

    We all head to the Mexican place for dinner – it’s Taco Tuesday. At the Taco place we see FJ, he's sharing a meal with a woman I have't seen before. We get absolutely stuffed on tacos, before heading back to our room to food coma, and watch a cheesy chick-flick. On our way back, we run into a hiker named Peter. We chat to him a bit, and he asks where a good place to stay in town is. Carlie offers him to sleep on the floor of our hotel room. Hannah and Jordan head to bed after the film, and suddenly we hear screaming coming from their room. “There’s a lizard in my bed!” exclaims Jordan. We walk over, and surely there is one of those blueish push-up lizards in her bed. We catch the lizard and deposit it outside. We finally all head to bed, exhausted from a day of doing not that much. Tomorrow we’re back on hiking clock, our alarms set for 6 am.
