      I wake up in the bed beside Carlie. I lie there for a bit, letting thoughts float by while I wait for the others to rise. It's pleasant in the room, the soft sun filling the room as it breaks through the pines.
      We’ve all decided to take a zero – the colloquial term for a day of no hiking. This gives me time to rest my injured knee, pcik up some groceries, and get a feel for the small California mountain town. When the others rise, we each do a load of sink laundry. My clothes dye the water brown no matter how many times I rinse them.

      Jordan and I head to the outdoor store, while Carlie and Hannah head to a crafts store. I pick up a pair of Darn Toughs, and ask one of the employees about snow conditions on Mt. San Jacinto. Prior to beginning the trail, I saw many posts on the PCT hikers Facebook group that said an ice axe and micro-spikes were still required for Mt. San Jacinto and Mt. Baden Powell - the two tallest peaks of the desert. In recent history, this would be unheard of, but because California had a snow dump of epic proportions throughout the winter and spring, the snow is lingering much longer than usual. To my delight, the employee informs me that the snow on both high desert peaks has receded susbtantially.

    We spend the rest of the day taking it easy - lounging in our hotel room, and watching movies. For dinner, we all head to the town's lone Mexican restaurant – it’s Taco Tuesday. We get absolutely stuffed on tacos before heading back to our room to experience a well deserved food coma.
    <br><br>
    On our way back, we run into a hiker named Peter. He asks if we know a good place to stay in town. Carlie offers him the floor of our hotel room, which he graciously accepts. As Hannah and Jordan head to bed after, we suddenly hear screaming coming from their room. “There’s a lizard in my bed!” exclaims Jordan. We walk over, and surely there is one of those blue push-up lizards in her bed. We catch the lizard and deposit it outside. We finally all head to bed, exhausted from a day of doing very little. Sitting still for an entire day has made me antsy, and I am excited to get back to hiking the following day.
