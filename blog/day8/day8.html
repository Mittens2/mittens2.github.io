    <h3>13 miles hiked, Mile 123</h3>

    I wake up the next morning feeling much more calm than the night before. I look over to see Carlie's book next to me. Carlie, FJ,  Ellen - a girl FJ had been hiking with, and I head to breakfast at the tavern. We get breakfast from a waitress with purple eyeshadow, she is sassy but friendly. Carlie tells us a funny story about going skinny dipping high, and having to run away from the cops. After breakfast, I head buy snacks from the gas station, so I say goodbye to Carlie - she is heading into Idyllwild with FJ to get new shoes and I'm not sure when I'll see her again.

    I walk back to the campsite through the golf course. My blisters from the previous section are still quite bad, so I decide to buy some  Leukotape - a type of really stick athletic tape, from Two Foot Adventures. They only sell the tape in huge rolls, I take what I need and give the rest to the two Canadian girls I had met at the spring the other day.

      I spend the rest of the afternoon chilling and reading the book Carlie lent me. With the experiences of the last few days, the messages in the book feel more profound - human connection, overcoming fear. Fear - I had a lot of it this past year. An intense amount of social anxiety that seemed to rise out of nowhere, preventing me from wandering around the city like I usually enjoy. It’s not as if the trail hasn’t brought about its own anxieties - cliques and miles and pains and finances, but somehow these anxieties are only with you when they are present, and that makes them more manageable. I decide to write Carlie a note telling her how much meeting her has positively influenced my hike. I leave the note for Carlie in her book, tucking it in the corner of her tent (along with a beer) and am off.

     I walk through a big field.  My knee is feeling ok, but I'm purposely not going fast so I won't aggravate the injury further. My mind wanders and I lose the trail. I retrace my steps, and find the point at which I’d wandered off trail - an ambiguous looking sign that really makes it look as if the way I went was correct. However, by now I am familiar with the tread unique to the PCT – well groomed from the thousands of hikers that travel the outdoor super-highway every year.
     <br><br>
    I walk through a strange wooded area with what looks like a ropes and course, and an outhouse. The trail eventually starts to climb. My knee is feeling great, and I begin to pick up the pace. I run into Zack who I haven't seen since my second day on trail! He’s limping, moving slowly. He seems to be suffering from the same pain that I was experiencing a couple of days ago. We walk together for a bit, catching up about what’s happened since we last saw each other. We fill up water together at a beautiful little desert stream, a big tree hanging over the creek. I leave Zack behind as I continue climbing.

    I end up hiking 14 miles despite only starting to walk at 2:30. There are some absolutely stunning views on the way up, accentuated by the setting sun. Behind me in the valley I can see Warner springs. I keep looking back and thinking about the friends I left behind.
    <br><br>
    Around 7:00, I feel suddenly exhausted, and am suddenly desperate for a place to camp. The climbing has ended, and I find myself on a fog-covered shoulder between two peaks, surrounded by tall bushes. I wander down a little side trail which leads to a small campsite carved into the shrubbery. I set up my tent, and walk further down the side trail to make dinner. I usually make dinner right beside my tent, but being alone is making me more cautious. The surrounding fog, and creeping night heightens my loneliness.
    <br><br>
    I rush through dinner to lie down in my tent. On the PCT people sleep with their food, something I would never do at home. But here I am by myself in the middle of the desert, using my food bag to prop up my busted knee. Despite knowing that the little bit of mesh that is my tent won’t actually keep me safer, I still feel much more relaxed once I’m inside. I listen to music, one earbud out, in case a cougar or wolve or desert bear tries to sneak attack me. I hear coyotes howling in the night. I couldn’t have picked an eerier spot to camp by myself for the very first time ever. The fear gets me excited, and I’m reminded of the chapter from Carlie's book. This is just another fear to get over. I pass out for the night.
