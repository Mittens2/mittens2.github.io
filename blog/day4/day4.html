    <h3>16 miles hiked, Mile 63</h3>

       I wake up at Laguna CG before any of the others. I have a slight headache, probably from exertion and dehydration. While I make breakfast, the others join me, and Nick asks to borrow my charger for his phone. I barely use mine, so I don't mind him using it. I leave the campsite and rejoin the trail, walking through the mist. As I walk, I remember that I never took the charger back from Nick. I decide to take a snack break and wait for him to pass me. The mist lifts, and I am suddenly on a massive mountainside overlooking the entire desert. It’s absolutely stunning.

       Brian and Nick catch me shortly after, and Nick returns the charger. Being a bit on a nature high, I decide to call my Dad. After my phone call, I walk behind a section hiker with a tiny pack. He tells me that the unspoken code is “10 by 10” (10 miles by 10 am), a code I would grow to have very mixed feelings about. My knee is feeling pretty good, and I continue walking with beautiful views of the desert way below the mountains to my right. After a little while, I catch up to Connor, a redhead who camped with us the night before. His knee is not doing too hot either. We walk for a bit, and take lunch under a giant boulder. We’re hiding from the sun, and apparently, also from the trail. We freak a bunch of day hikers as they round the boulder.

      After lunch we keep walking, quickly catching up to the day hikers. I had heard from some other PCTers that there is this big rock that looks like an Eagle coming up. I ask the day hikers whether they’ve heard of it, and if they know how close it is. They laugh and say that it’s over 30 miles away (it was about 50 miles away at that point). The pain in my knee returns, but I fight through, trying to maintain the same pace. Connor is lagging behind, and before too long I lose him.

      I eventually get to an unmarked stream and fill up. I take a snack break, and a couple of dudes – both about my age, both very fast with tiny packs, pass me without saying much. I walk for a bit and eventually get to a massive downhill. Downhills are the worst for my knee. I hobble along in pain, and eventually reach the lowest point. I can barely move. I’m also out of water. Fuck. I try to walk, but the pain is too much and I sit back down. I’m in the middle of dried up stream, and there’s no shade in sight. My morale plummets, and I start thinking that maybe I can’t do this PCT thing. I haven’t even walked 60 miles, and I want to quit. It’s a huge climb out of the dry riverbed, and I really wonder whether I’ll be able to make it up.  At an immensely slow pace, I begin to limp up the hill – an old dirt road. I take many breaks. There’s no campsite for miles on my maps.

    As I sit, feeling defeated, I get passed by a 60+ year old guy. His name is Rich. “I’m gonna camp at the nearest spot that I see fit,” he says. Rich walks super slow, but he’s very consistent. I feel a bit bad getting passed by people older than my parents, but his mentality helps me. Up until then I’d been scouting the maps and making sure to only camp at marked locations. At about mile 63, the trail rounds the top of the hill, and the sight of the desert shakes me to my core. To my left are the Laguna mountains, green, with soft clouds slowly creeping over them. To my right, are the San Bernardino mountains, totally barren, with the setting sun making them glow an intense red.

    I decide to cowboy camp – a term that I heard about while scouring the various PCT blogs I read prior to the trail. I spread out my ground sheet, a cutout of an Alaska Airlines bag, and throw my inflatable mat on top of it. I find myself once again totally high on the surrounding beauty. I eventually make dinner, and attempt to sleep. My sleep is not as good as it was in the tent, I wake up a couple of times, only to be welcomed by the infinite starry sky above me. This comforting sight lulls back to sleep each time.
