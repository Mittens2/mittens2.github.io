    <h1>Day 6</h1>
    <h2>May 12th, 2017</h2>
    <h3>20 miles hiked, Mile 101</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Our alarms wake us at 5:45 am. The sun is just beginning to make its way into the sky as we emerge from out tents. The others eat their oatmeal cold. I do the same. Today I feel like listening to music. I haven’t listened to any music while walking in the first five days. I put on Juniper Arms by Adam Torres, a song I heard on the NPR podcast “All Songs Considered” just a couple of days before I left for the trail. The tune matches the desert atmosphere perfectly – in fact, there’s quite a bit of junipers as we walk.
    <br><br>
    My knee is feeling good, and the music gets me into a good trance. I manage to make it the first 6 miles without needing an Ibuprofen. I finally cave as my knee pain overwhelms me. This morning the trail cuts along a sharp cliff, quite scary to walk along, a small misstep and there’s a massive drop that will surely end a thru-hike. Afterwards, the desert relaxes into a flat plane with large bushes everywhere. I get to a split in the trail to the only water source of the day. I see Will and Keenan at the split, they’ve already gotten water and are going to walk on. There’s a cave called Billy Goat’s Cave up ahead, they say they’ll wait for us there.

     When I get to the cache there are two girls there. We chat for a bit. They tell me that they started on the 3rd – 4 days before me, but are taking their time. Carlie gets to the cache a bit after. Carlie is a social butterfly and the conversation immediately becomes fun and flowy. I feel close to Carlie, which is apparent. The girls are shocked to find out that we had only met the day prior. It’s crazy how close you can get to someone in a single day on trail. Spending all of your waking hours sharing such an intense emotional and physical experience will do that. I felt this way when I spent two weeks on the Camino a couple of years prior, friends that I had known for only days felt like friends back home who I had known for years. As we chat with the girls, I learn that they are also Canadian. They both recently finished their degrees at Carleton.
     <br><br>
     It’s close to noon by the time we leave the cache – just about siesta time, the cave still 4 miles down the trail. We walk two sweltering miles uphill, when Carlie says that she has to stop. In the desert you usually hike in the early morning and late afternoon, with a lunch and siesta separating the two walking chunks. This is the way I was used to hiking in the Israeli desert, a hiking style that totally suits me.

     Carlie and I break in a little cave carved into the desert bushes, the only shade available to us. We eat lunch and immediately fall into deep chats. Carlie talks about how she believes in a kind of natural mysticism, how all people are connected through nature. She believes that we can communicate in ways that are not consciously available to us. She cites the fact that many civilizations which had no contact, devised similar myths. Although not extremely spiritual, I also believe in a sort of natural mysticism. Often when I'm outside I feel like I am undergoing a religious experience.

     We keep walking once its cooled down a bit. We both wonder whether the boys are waiting for us at the cave ahead. When we get to Billy Goat’s Cave, it is empty. We go inside and smoke a one-hitter. When I get out of the cave, I realize that I’m quite high. We walk the next couple of miles through long golden grass, neither of us saying a word. The trail is up above everything, and we can see an expanse of land in front us. To our left are some houses scattered amongst the desert shrubbery. Further on all I can see is yellow, the real desert I think to myself.
     <br><br>
     I look down the trail, and see some rocks placed in a somewhat peculiar manner. When I get closer I see that they spell out “100”. We’ve done our first 100 miles on trail! We stop to celebrate for a little. It’s getting later in the day, already 6 pm at this point, and we decide that we’ll camp at Barrel Springs one mile ahead. We keep on walking on, when suddenly my knee totally gives out. I get to the springs barely able to put one foot in front of the other.

    The springs have a somewhat strange vibe. There is a kind of swampy grassy area next to them. A few hikers who look about our age are there. They look over, but do not say anything. Carlie and I find a spot by ourselves to eat dinner. She calls her mom while I make ramen. After dinner, Carlie and I spread out our groundsheets, and throw our mats on top of them. We lie down next to each other in our sleeping bags, and chat. We decide that we’ll cowboy camp for the night. As we’re lying there, the bugs decide to come out. We set up our tents as we are swarmed by mosquitoes. We chat for a while longer, before dozing off. The next day we are heading into Warner Springs, and I wonder whether we'll hike out together.
