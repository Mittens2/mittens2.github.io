    When I wake up, the wind is still howling. I am proud of my tent for having made it through the night. I’m so ready to get out of this gale, so I pack up my stuff without eating breakfast. The other two are still asleep. After about a mile of walking, the wind completely stops. We camped right at a pass where the wind is funnelled into by the surrounding peaks - bad choice for a campsite.

    I walk for a bit longer – it’s a beautiful ridge walk. I am above the clouds, and can see mountains shrouded in fog up ahead. After a bit, I run into a woman I haven't seen before. She tells me her name is Sun-up. She eventually asks me if I want a bracelet with a bible verse inscribed on it, she isn’t pushy saying that some people even prefer to use them as elastics.

     I keep walking and make breakfast a short while later. My knee is already hurting a bit, and I'm worried about the descent into Idyllwild - it's supposed to be pretty gnarly. Once I start the descent, it’s quite painful going, and I have to take it slow. I’m sure that Cheswick and Patrick are going to catch me any minute. After the downhill, I get to the end of the walkable PCT, and peel off on the alternate - something farm road - down to the highway. It’s pretty easy going. After a bit Cheswick and Patrick finally catch me. They stop to take a break at a water source, while I press on. I want to take as few breaks as possible, hoping that by the time my knee fully gives out I'll already be in town.

    After a long walk down a dirt road, I finally see the highway up ahead. Between me and the highway is a field with some pretty big bulls. I take a bit of roundabout way, avoiding the cattle, trying not to make eye contact. I finally get to the highway, throwing my pack down in the dirt. I feel good having done the alternate despite my knee pain. I pull out my maps and try to figure out where the alternate goes from here, without much luck. I eventually give up trying to decipher my location. I know that the alternate involves quite a bit of highway walking, so I decide that I’ll just start the road walk now.

    After about a minute of walking on the shoulder of the highway, a car pulls up beside me. A man rolls down the car window. "A couple of weeks ago I was exactly where you are now. It doesn't get any better". He asks me if I want a ride to Idyllwild. After a bit of deliberation, I take him up on it. My knee isn't doing great, and I don't really mind skipping the road walk. I’m here to walk trail miles, not highway miles. He tells me that he had been hiking the PCT with his son when he got a viral infection of the heart. It sounds terrible. He says that he made it to Wrightwood (mile 365ish) when he finally had to call it quits. He drops me off at the campsite in Idyllwild.

    I take my phone off of airplane mode, and see some texts from Carlie. She is hitching in from Paradise Valley, and was wondering if I wanted to split a motel room with her and two other girls. I head out of the campground, and loiter in the middle of town, not really knowing what to do with myself in the meantime. I see a hiker I have run into a couple of times on trail. I ask him if he knows of any good places to eat. He says that he is heading to a place right now, and that I can join him if I feel like it. He tells me his trail name is Ninja - he always seems to come out of nowhere on trail, and it sounds like other people have had the same experience.

    We eat beef chilly with corn bread - the corn bread is heavenly. He says there's supposed to be a good cafe in town, so we head out in its direction. The cafe is decorated with lots of cool DIY stuff - wooden ornaments, and old film photos of the desert. Ninja says that one day he wants to own a cafe just like this one. Two other PCT hikers - a couple I had seen once or twice before, join us at our table. The guy is funny in a kind of family guy type of way. The girl is cheery and has a beautiful smile. We sit there trading jokes, until I receive a text from Carlie asking me if I want to come hang out in the motel room. I say goodbye, but tell Ninja I'd text him if we go out.

   When I get to the room, I give Carlie a big hug. Hannah and Jordan are there too - until then I hadn't known which girls Carlie was hiking with. We head to a Mexican restaurant for dinner, and on our way back see Birdie, Possum, Tink, and Patrick. They ask us to join them for a drink, and we have nothing else to do so we oblige them. The alcohol and the pause from crushing miles daily has us in high spirits. I genuinely like all of the people I am surrounded by, and am beginning to feel quite comfortable in this group.

   We decide to head back to our room for a smoke, and I end up getting pretty high. At one point someone tries to describe a campsite they'd slept at, when I interject, saying that "it was the one with a stream and a tree." Everyone laughs because a good fraction of the campsites thus far have had "a stream and a tree". Eventually everyone heads to their respective motel rooms. I fall asleep quickly after lying down - the weed has taken its effect.
