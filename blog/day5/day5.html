    <h1>Day 5</h1>
    <h2>May 11th, 2017</h2>
    <h3>18 miles hiked, Mile 81</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
      I wake up the next morning just as the sun is rising. I look down at my foot. A bunch of the blisters I’ve developed over the past couple of days have now morphed into one super-blister. I start walking, again with little motivation. Just 7 more miles to Scissor’s Crossing where I can hitch to Julian. I wasn’t planning on getting off at Julian, but now feel like I have to because of the knee pain. I wonder if I will get back on trail if I get off. After 30 minutes of hiking, I get passed by the two young guys with the small packs from the day before. I was convinced that they were ahead of me. Just 15 minutes later, a girl catches up to me. She asks me when the two guys passed me, and I tell her that it was about 15 minutes ago. She looks unhappy with that information and takes off down the trail, much faster than I can in my current state. I never expect to see them again.
      <br><br>
      There’s a water cache just another mile ahead. However, according to the water report it's completely dry, and the only other water before Scissors Crossing is 2 miles off trail, but I am totally dry and will likely have to tack on the extra miles. When I reach the cache, the two guys and the girl are there.  They introduce themselves – Will, Keenan, and Carlie. They also have great news – there’s some water left in the cache! As I drain water from the cache, it goes dry. I get about a litre of water from it, just enough to make it to Scissor’s Crossing if I ration. I feel bad for drawing the last bit of water from the cache, knowing that other hikers must be right behind me.

       Carlie is super friendly, and I ask her about my blister. She says she recently took a Wilderness First Responder course, and that my blister doesn’t look infected, likely just redness from the friction. She asks me if she can drain it for me. Although this feels pretty up front and personal for a first encounter, I agree. She pokes the blister with a sewing needle, and squeezes it hard. It doesn’t hurt much. Will and Carlie say that they’ve both been having lots of knee pain as well, and have been combatting it by popping a bunch of advils every morning. I have advil, but usually don’t like to rely on it. Their easygoing demeanour relaxes me, and I decide that I will try and hike with them.
       <br><br>
      Will and Keenan get ahead, and soon it’s just me and Carlie hiking down the side of Mt. Rodriguez.  We take a break beneath a large boulder. Carlie is surprised that we didn’t meet earlier on the trail. When we get to the bottom of the hill, Carlie is very excited. “I saw a jack-rabbit!” she exclaims. She says it was three feet long. I tell her I don’t believe her, and this makes her even more animated.  Eventually we reach the highway that leads into Julian. Scissor’s Crossing is just another mile down the trail. There’s a sign for burgers, and Carlie thinks we should try and hitch to get some food. I love her spontaneity. I am reminded that I am out here on my own accord, and any pain I'm suffering is voluntary, I don't have to do this. However, my mood has drastically improved since the morning. I do wanna be out here, I think. Will and Keenan told us that they'd be waiting for us at the underpass, so we trudge on.

      We soon reach Scissor's Crossing, and it's a beautiful sight. Will’s parents are doing trail magic under the bridge! There’s an abundance of fruit, veggies, and beer.  As we sit enjoying the delights of fresh food, the dude from the Mt. Laguna outdoor store shows up. He tells Carlie that the pain that she (and I) are experiencing is due to her IT band, a common, but painful overuse injury. He says it’s good to carry around a tennis ball, and stop to roll out the IT band every once in a while. Carlie asks me to roll out her IT band, and that’s how “pain time” becomes a thing. Carlie yells in pain as I run a beer bottle down her leg.

      Bob and Peter, two older guys show up. Bob is flamboyant, and shares the same home state as Keenan and Carlie - Michigan. Peter is an older Dutch guy I’ve run into a couple of times, who has a very over the top sense of humour, and wild look in his eyes. A dude named Roland shows up. He studies Anthropology at a nearby university, and is doing his degree on thru-hikers. He asks some generic questions about our motivations for doing the trail. A while later, a local sheriff shows up. Although we all feel a bit uneasy at first, we quickly warm up to him. The sheriff spots an illegal alien a few feet away, hiding in a bush. We all think he is going to arrest the man. The sheriff walks over to him, and then returns. “I offered him water and food, but he refused.” We all marvel at the sheriff’s good heart, a refreshing scene after all of the police brutality you hear about.

    At around 4 pm, we finally decide that the desert heat is worth braving. It is still extremely hot as we begin to climb the other side of the valley. My knee feels surprisingly good, and I am able to keep up with Keenan on the uphill. We find a dry riverbed near the top of the plateau, where we set up our tents. We all share a joint, and talk for a bit before going to bed. I think how fortunate I am to have met Carlie. My thru-hike lives on.
