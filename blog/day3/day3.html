    <h1>Day 3</h1>
    <h2>May 9th, 2017</h2>
    <h3>15 miles hiked, Mile 47</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
      I wake up after a very cold night. I make breakfast, and start walking at a  slow pace due to the pain in my knee. On day 1 I was walking at about 2.5 miles per hour. Now I walk barely faster than 1 mph. The trail starts to climb – I’m winding my way away from the desert canyons and up into the Laguna Mountains. As I climb, my pace begins to pick up – the endorphins clouding the pain. I play leapfrog with the Aussie guy that camped with me at Fred Canyon, passing each other every few minutes until I finally lose him. The trail turns into a green wonderland, with large bushes and trees alongside a stream. It’s cloudy and cozy in this high desert forest.

      At mile 37, I run into Mark packing up camp. It’s 9 am, late start for a hiker. Mark says he also has knee pain, which forced him to stop earlier than the others, and take the morning off. I climb into the clouds, passing some snowy patches. Snow in the desert – now I’m totally confused.

      I catch up to Jordan and Hannibal - the two girls who were camped by me last night, just a couple of miles outside of Mt. Laguna. We gel right away, talking about all sorts of things, politics (i.e. how good looking our Prime Minister is). Mark catches up to us, and we emerge from the forest into a campground with dirt roads. Mt. Laguna lies just past this campground. Mt. Laguna is a funny “town”, essentially a single road with a tavern, a gear store, and a small supermarket. We head for the tavern, where I order beef chili with cheese, and a beer. I feel really good in this moment – relaxed from making it to my first town, surrounded by company. I get a little buzzed on the single beer, my tolerance clearly fading already.

     Afterwards we head for the outfitter. The outfitter has the most outrageous hiker box – sawyer filters, stoves, pots, even a sleeping mat. It seems that like me, many people leave their house without ever having tried out their gear. The Laguna outfitters have an amazing business model, having all of the classic UL (ultralight) necessities which are so hard to get in the city – Gossamer Gear packs, titanium pots, and tarptents. Jordan and Hannibal are whisked away by one the workers, only to emerge with Jordan having replaced what seems like half of her gear. Me, determined not to spend too much money (I left home with only about 3k Canadian in my bank account), just grab a knee brace. I stop at the hiker box and unload any extra gear – 3 sawyer bags, a bandana, med gloves, floss, sponge (for cleaning my stove), soap, scissors, a bunch of extra stuff sacks (I hold on to my red coffee cup for now). The weight has been pretty unbearable, and has definitely contributed to me busting my knee in the early going.

     I go to resupply at the small grocery store. The store is tiny, but has all of the hiking essentials. I spread out my loot on a bench outside, and begin removing any unnecessary packaging. As I do this, a couple of teens sit beside me. One of them begins talking to me, wondering what the hell I am doing. I tell him about the PCT. He’s from the area, but apparently has never heard of it. He tells me I’m crazy, but also kind of cool. I quite appreciate his response.

    I decide to walk 5 more miles – to the Laguna Campground. I walk behind this kind of wacky older dutch guy who I’ve run into a couple of times on trail. After a few miles, we emerge from the high desert forest, and are carving our way across a steep mountainside. The massive expanse of the desert lies beneath us, shocking me with how far down below it is, and how deserty it looks from up here. I eventually reach the side trail that leads onto a highway, and down to the Laguna Campground. It’s surprisingly far down the highway, and my knee is still in a lot of pain. The walk feels like it takes a lifetime.

    When I get to the campground, it is completely deserted. It’s creepy as hell, and has multiple warning signs, one about rattlesnakes, and another about nuclear radiation. It’s also $24 to camp, with a hefty fine if you don’t. What the absolute fuck. I decide that I'll keep hiking, not wanting to spend the night alone in this creepy-ass campground.
    <br><br>
    It’s 6:00 pm when I leave, and my knee is killing me. I feel the stress creeping in. On my way back I see a strange hiker walking towards me on the highway. He’s super tall, lanky, and quite hip. His backpack is the smallest I’ve seen yet – 8 pounds he tells me! His name is Nick, and he’s also planning on spending the night. We chat for a bit, and I decide to join him – a companion in the campsite from hell! As we read over the various warnings, Jordan, Hannibal, and two other hikers show up. One of them is Brian, a hiker I had met Bob’s! We cook together, and hang out, cracking jokes. Eventually the sun fades from the sky and it becomes cold fast. We’re quite high up, just under 7000 ft. We all retreat to our respective tents (for Nick a tarp), and talk for a bit before dozing off for the night. What a difference friends make.
