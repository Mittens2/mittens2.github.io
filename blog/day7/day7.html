    <h1>Day 7</h1>
    <h2>May 13th, 2017</h2>
    <h3>8 miles hiked, Mile 109</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
   Carlie and I wake up early. We want to cover the 8 miles left to Warner Springs before the day gets too hot. We start hiking, and my knee feels pretty good. Carlie complains about hers, and for the second day in a row I get a bit ahead of her. After less than an hour of walking, we get caught by one of the other hikers from the spring – a hiker who’s trail name is Tink. Tink is super talkative, she reminds me of a girl I hiked with on the Camino.
   <br><br>
   We get to a really beautiful desert spring surrounded by large oak trees just as the sun is starting to peak out from behind the San Bernardino mountains. Carlie and I lose Tink when we stop for a break. Once we continue hiking, we find ourselves in a large grassland with cows grazing. From our viewpoint yesterday, we could see this massive yellow expanse, mistaking it for sandy dunes. The walk is calming, and I take a bit of a detour so I don’t have to walk between the cows.

      We catch up to Tink at Eagle Rock – finally! I was way off when I asked those day hikers about it a couple of days back. A 19 year-old hiker named Dutch catches us. Although only 19, he’s more experienced than both Carlie and I, having done the AT the year before. We spend time taking pictures of each other on the rock, each person taking their turn to scale the structure. Carlie shows off her climbing skills with some flashy moves. It’s kind of a silly time and we’re all laughing. Dutch takes off first, and is quickly swallowed by the hills. Tink, Carlie, and I walk the rest of the way to Warner Springs together. Tink splits from us less than a mile from the road that leads into Warner Springs, a detour that takes you right to the post office. Not too long after, we arrive at the community centre.

     The centre is an old white building. In front are a couple of chairs, and a cool looking metallic RV, a mobile thru-hiking store called Two Foot Adventures. Keenan and Will come out to greet us. They’re looking much cleaner than before and tell us about the bucket showers out back. After not showering for an entire week, I could use any form of shower. One of the volunteers at the community centre tells us to make sure there’s no rattlesnakes in the shower stall before we go in... The bucket shower is a god-send, pouring the cold water on my dust-covered body feels so good. I find some clothes in the hiker box, and give my hiking clothes a bucket shower as well.

    I hang out for a bit, chatting with other hikers who I’ve never met. Mark is the lone person I see from my first day – a day that now feels infinitely far in the past. The vibes are great, and my body feels amazing not walking. Me, Carlie, Mark, and a guy that Carlie knows from earlier on trail decide to hitch into town. The first person who sees us picks us up. I go to the post office to pick up a box I sent myself – in the pre-trail town guide, Warner Springs was listed as one of the few towns that it’s better to send a box to. I still have so much food from the beginning of the trail, thinking I would be eating 4000 calories a day right away. I easily have enough to make it to Idyllwild. I decide to send the box ahead to Kennedy Meadows, the small town that marks the end of the desert, and the portal into the Sierras. It feels unimaginably far away.

    Mark and I head to the tavern at the golf club – the only restaurant in town. Carlie, and her friend, FJ are already there. We all order Cheeseburgers with bacon, I get a coffee as well. After the meal we all hitch back together. A car quickly pulls over. Once we’re inside we realize our mistake - our driver is drunk. He has a hat that has his own name printed on it - “Ralph”. Luckily the drive is only a mile. Ralph tries to give us life advice on the two minute car ride, “life is short! …” he proclaims a couple of times, trailing off before he can make his full point.
    <br><br>
    Me, Tink, Carlie, FJ, and a couple in their thirties – Possum and Birdy - friends of Tink, grab beers and head to a picnic table on the grass. Possum, Birdy, and Tink all have hippie vibes, they’re really positive to be around. Tink says something really ridiculous about bunny behaviour. We all laugh. The beer is loosening me up, my social anxiety receding. Me and FJ get into a drunken conversation, and he tells me about the reason he’s on trail - his best companion, his cat of 15 years passed away a couple of months ago.
    <br><br>
    I head to bed drunk. As I lie there, I recall mine and Carlie's conversation from the other day. She wanted me to read the first chapter of her book to understand the form of natural mysticism she was describing. I'm planning on heading out the next day, while Carlie is zeroing, so I might not get a chance to read it otherwise. She hands me the book, and tells me to put it in her tent the before I leave. I read the first chapter, my mind barely holding on to the words. I soon fall asleep for the night.
