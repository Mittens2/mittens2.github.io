    <h3>20 miles hiked, Mile 20</h3>

     Bob opens the door to our room at 4:15 am. “Wake up, we’re leaving in 30 minutes,” he says. I was planning on sleeping until 4:30… So much for that.  Everything is already packed from the night before, so I go to the kitchen, make a bagel with PB, pour myself some coffee, and grab a banana. We jump into Bob’s car. I am the only one going to the trailhead today. We talk a bit about the weather – the forecast is calling for thunderstorms. Bob drops me off at the terminus at 5:40 am. It is pouring rain, but I still want a monument picture. Bob snaps a photo – it's blurry and impossible to tell that the person in the picture is me.

    Bob takes off, and I am left to stand at the terminus, slightly frozen in fear by the magnitude of the adventure I am about to undertake. I open the terminus log, with no idea of what to write. I feel anxious, as if every hiker that is ever going to hike the trail after me is looking over my shoulder. “From Canada to Canada” I finally scribe, feeling somewhat unsatisfied. I click my poles into place, and start down the trail – mechanically placing pole, then foot one after the other. I feel ridiculous, having never used hiking poles before in my life. I hike 6 hours without seeing a single person. Later I learn that a van full of hikers who stayed with the more popular trail angels, Scout and Frodo, were dropped off a mere 40 minutes after me. On the PCT you can be just minutes ahead of somebody and not see them for days at a time. The desert takes me by surprise – it's full of plants, nothing like the Judean Desert, my childhood home.

    The rain lets up after 15 minutes. I walk by the small town of Campo – not a soul in site. I pass the 1 mile marker, and later a sign that reads “Mexico 3 miles, Canada 2,647 miles”. There is something immensely pleasing about this sign. The end is so far, not even tangible. The only experience that matters is now. I keep hiking – passing many towering yuca plants and big beautiful boulders. I stop to fill water, using my Sawyer filter for the very first time. Luckily, I am able to figure it out no problem – I can’t believe I left my house without even testing half of my gear. I hike most of the morning with a strange pain in my left knee. I pause to take a snack  break and check the distance I've gone. 10 miles! And it isn’t even 10 yet. The words of caution from the hiker at Bob’s house become irrelevant. The rain picks up, and I throw the rain cover over my not-very-thru-hikey North Face pack.

    Just before Hauser Canyon, I finally see my first hikers – section hikers heading the opposite way. They are hiking the short section from Lake Morena to Campo, and are planning on driving back up to Lake Morena to camp for the night. One of them – Bison, thru-hiked the trail in 2016. “You’re making good time!” he tells me. I take lunch on a large boulder overlooking the canyon. It feels comforting to sit, truly alone for the first time in a while. At home I spent much more than a few hours at a time without seeing anyone, but there is something about moving and still not seeing anyone that gives the loneliness a totally different quality.

    After lunch, 3 guys about my age catch up to me. All three of them stayed at Scout and Frodo’s. Two of them are friends, and have a mildly rednecky vibe. The other guy, Daniel, is hiking with them for the morning. I join them as we all descend into the Canyon. The pace is fast – much faster than when I was walking on my own. Daniel and I lose the other two as they take a break at the base of the canyon. Daniel is a couple of years older than me, and currently in a Physics PhD program. He says that he came to an agreement with his supervisor to take the summer off and hike the trail, but had to be done by September. Daniel has a tiny pack – a ULA, and I ask him questions about his base weight. Daniel hiked the AT the summer prior, and said it helped him get his gear down to 12 pounds for the PCT. Mine is hovering around 20. We hike in the rain and hail for the rest of the afternoon. After the ascent from Hauser, I start to get very cold. I am stopping often to try and warm up my extremities.

    Daniel and I arrive at Lake Morena around 2 pm – 20 miles done! However, the pain in my knee has become a full on throb. I am also very cold. I decide to stop here, while Daniel goes on. That was the last we would see of each other. I walk through the campground to a grassy area where a couple of tents are set up. There are two older men hanging out under a veranda. They say that they did not hike today due to the rain. I join them, throwing on all of my dry clothes, but still unable to warm up.
    <br><br>
    As I sit there eating snacks, attempting to coax some warmth back into my body, more hikers show up. Josh, Briar, Kansas, Mark, Ben, Zack, AT-Zack, Kamran, and Bison. I am feeling extremely socially anxious, and don’t make much conversation with anyone. Bison is schooling us all with advice from his 2016 thru-hike. He talks about the Sierras, getting away with hiking without a permit, Northern California. All of these things are just unknown concepts in my mind. I attempt to make my first dinner – Israeli couscous, an utter disaster. Way too much water, no flavour. Eventually, we all get tired, and set up our tents. I sit in my tent shivering for what feels like hours, unable to warm up. Finally, fatigue overtakes me and I pass out for my first night on trail.
