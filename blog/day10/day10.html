    <h3>20 miles hiked, Mile 161</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
     I wake up in my windy campsite, and put everything away. I run into Cheswick and Patrick a couple of miles later just as they are getting onto the trail. Feels like deja-vu. We hike together for a bit, until Cheswick gets ahead of Socrepes and I. Socrepes explains to me that he is a Buddhist, and says that I he's been doing a lot of contemplative walking. He says I should do the same - that it will help with my knee pain. My mom told me the exact same thing when I called her from Warner Springs, so now I'm beginning to feel like it’s a sign. We walk together until the first water cache. Cheswick and Patrick take off before me as I decide to stay a little longer so I can rest my knee.

    I walk for a while before I get to a cache called Walden. Walden is a strange sight to behold. As you arrive at the cache, you are greeted by three life-sized printouts of Thoreau, Whitman, and John Muir. There’s a little library of books that can be taken out by hikers. After reading Carlie's book, I’m craving some reading material, so I grab a small book of poems by Walt Whitman. As I'm perusing the books of Walden, and older couple pulls up. Their names are Carol Lee and Michael. They are really nice, Carol Lee is especially funny - she talks really slow and gently as if I am an 8 year old child. Later I learn she is a kindergarten teacher.

    The next stop is Paradise Valley Cafe, rumoured to have the best burger on the entire trail. It’s one long mile from the PCT, on the shoulder of a state highway. When I get to café, I see a bunch of familiar faces - Bob, Peter, Brian, Josh, Tink, Possum, Birdie, Patrick, and Cheswick. I eat a medium rare burger with the works – the experience is heavenly. Most of the people at the café are hitching into Idyllwild from here. The trail used to get very close to Idyllwild, accessible via the Devil’s Slide Trail at mile 179. Unfortunately, a fire in 2014 closed the section between mile 167 and 179, so to forego hitching from Paradise Valley means having to get off of the PCT via a side trail, followed by a 10 mile road walk. My knee is feeling a bit better, and I feel that if there are more trail miles, I want to see them. When I pay my bill, the Latino waitress tells me that I’m going to love Idyllwild. I smile, this gives me some energy for the upcoming section.

    I go outside and hang out with the other hikers on the deck of the cafe. A stranger comes over and hands us a bag of fresh oranges. I eat one and get orange juice all over myself - hikertrash mode taking over.

    I keep walking and am feeling great. I decide to take Patrick's advice and try some contemplative walking. It’s calming, and I become entranced with my surroundings. I walk quite fast as I get into a sort of flow state. I catch up to Cheswick and Patrick who are also doing the alternate. They say that they are going to mile 161, which sounds pretty good to me, but also means this will be my biggest day yet - 22 miles (20 trail miles).

    We eventually get to a mountain pass where there is a trail to a spring a mile off of the PCT. I am running low on water, but also don't want to hike another two extra miles. On my Halfmile app it shows that there is actually another cache only 0.3 miles off trail in the opposite direction. I start down the trail and quickly realize that it’s more of a steep bushwhack down an overgrown dirt road. I think of turning back a bunch of times. However, I press on - get over the fear, I tell myself. I eventually get to the spring, and there is clear bueatiful water flowing. I am overjoyed. The walk back seems really long too, but I eventually find myself back on the ridge.

    The last few miles are really tough - my knee is hurting from pushing it all day, and I can't wait to stop walking. When I make it to camp, Cheswick and Scorepes are there, their tents set up underneath a bramble of short desert trees. On the other side of the trail, there is room for a single tent. It  is surrounded by a pile of bear scat, a patch of snow, and an overhanging dead tree. On top of this, the wind is raging, turning the air freezing cold. I think that if I survive tonight, I can survive anything  the trail throws at me. We eat dinner together, but retreat quickly to our tents due to the howling wind. I fall asleep pretty early, but wake up an hour later with my tent collapsed on me. The wind is brutal and not letting up at all. I muster the courage to leave my tent, and re-stake it in the dark. This seems to do the trick, and although the wind is still battering the side of my tent, I manage to fall asleep for the night. I sleep well.
