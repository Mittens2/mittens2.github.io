    <h3>12 miles hiked, Mile 32</h3>

      I wake up feeling refreshed. It’s a bit foggy, and still wet from the night before. I pull out my pot and luxury item – a plastic cup, and prepare some oatmeal and coffee. Some hikers have already left, while others are still getting up around me. I start walking out of Lake Morena on my own, feeling a bit uncomfortable with how little I connected with the others. I pass a tree with a bunch of crows on it .

     I eventually catch up to Zack, and we hike together for a while. We are walking through an overgrown desert, sand beneath our feet, large desert plants all around. Little bunnies skirt back and forth across the trail. Zack is astounded by the sight of it all. Zack is from England, and says that they don’t get this sort of wilderness where he’s from. Somehow him being astounded by the bunnies makes me appreciate the scene we’re walking through more.

     As we continue down the sandy trail, my knee pain returns – only much worse than the day before. It’s hard to even bend my knee. I contemplate taking a long break when we arrive at a stream beneath a bridge. I end up leaving before Zack, getting my feet wet crossing the stream. I continue to walk alone, the knee pain slowly creeping up on me. I pass through another campground – Boulder Oaks, where I say hello to a couple. I stop about a mile later, at the top of a small hill where Ben is sitting. We chat for a while. We talk about gear, about philosophy. We take off together, but I quickly tell Ben to go ahead, my knee pain is getting worse and I can’t keep up. Eventually, Kansas and Zack catch up. Again I try to walk with them, but can’t. I round a bend, and there’s beautiful little canyon with a stream at the bottom. Ben, Zack, and Kansas are hanging out in the stream, having a blast. I hang out above, unable to descend to the water.

    As I sit there, two cute girls walk by with their dog. One of them flashes me a smile, and I feel a little lighter. I continue on, getting ahead of the other 3, but by the time I get to the 32 mile marker, I can’t go on. Ben, Zack, Kansas, and AT-Zack join me as I sit by another small stream. Usually the trail is much drier in these parts, but a very wet winter has injected life into the veins of the desert. We hang out, AT-Zack pulling out a joint. We have good conversations, talk a lot about gear, and about the perils ahead. Again the Sierras are mentioned. I watched some videos prior to leaving about the high passes and the river crossings, but have yet to fully internalize the might of the Sierras in a high snow year. I gauge the others about what I should do with my knee. Eventually, I decide that I’ll camp here for the night while the others go on.

    I spend the rest of the day hanging out in the trees by the river – journaling, listening to podcasts, thinking how distant this experience already feels from everything back at home. A middle aged Australian guy joins me at some point. We have an awkward conversation, me continuing my streak of social anxiety at camp. Two other girls join us without saying anything, setting up their tents on the far side of the campsite.
    I spend the rest of the day listening to music and daydreaming. As night falls, I also fall asleep, hoping my knee feels better the next morning.
