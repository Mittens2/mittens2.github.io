    <h3>18 miles hiked, Mile 197</h3>

  <p>
     We wake up early. A friend of the Inn, Bob, is giving hikers rides up to the bottom of the Devil’s Slide Trail. The five of us pile into the back of Bob’s pickup, and speed away from the motel up the winding road. There is something comforting about heading towards the trail, the same feeling you usually get heading home from a long hike. It's funny to have the roles of nature and the city reserved, but in reality the trail is our home for the next five months. Our plan today is to summit San Jacinto, an alternate that adds a couple of miles and some elevation, but worth it for the views at the top of the solitary desert peak. Bob drops us off, and we start up the Devil’s Slide. I decide to try and keep up with Peter. Peter hikes fast, but my body is feeling good, so I keep up with him, even passing him a few times before reaching the PCT. Once back on trail, I feel the morning coffee hit me, and I suddenly need to shit like never before. I walk-run the next mile, until I finally find a massive boulder to build a cat-hole behind. Afterwards, I see that I am at the point where the alternate splits from the main trail. I wait for Carlie and the girls for 15, 30, 45 minutes… And they don’t show up. I’ve only been hiking for two hours, and hope that nothing has happened to them

    I leave, deciding to summit on my own. I’ll wait for them at the top, where I can pass time looking out over the desert expanse. I start up the climb, and soon find myself in a flat spot on the mountain – a saddle point, that is totally covered in snow. I wander around a bit, trying to follow tracks before losing the trail completely. I pull out my GPS and spend a good 10 minutes finding the trail. The hiking is extremely slow going. The entire Sierras are going to be like this, I think to myself. After the saddle point, there is still a decent amount of snow, but at least the trail is visible. The trail emerges from the high desert forest, and I enter a sea of mountains. Just ahead of me, there is an older man hiking with two ski poles. I catch up to him, and we hike together for a bit, me having to slow my suddenly fast pace so he can keep up. His name is Brent, and he’s originally from South Africa. He’s a section hiker, hiking from Idyllwild to Wrightwood. After a little, he tells me that he doesn’t want to slow me down, and that I should go ahead. I jet up the rest of the mountain, maybe my knee is finally healed. Just below the summit, I run into Ellen and two Swiss brothers I’d met earlier on trail chilling next to an alpine hut. They say that the summit is just up ahead. I drop my bag, and scramble the last hundred meters to the top. At the summit, I am treated to panoramic views of the surrounding desert. I’ve experienced snow-capped mountains, and arid desert individually, but rarely the two juxtaposed like they are now. Southern California is a pretty magical place.

     I spend some time taking in the surrounding beauty, before heading back to the hut. Ellen and the Swiss bros are still there. I lounge with them, eating lunch for about an hour and a half. I eventually decide to keep hiking, feeling a bit sad that I am leaving Carlie behind again. A little bit before the alternate rejoins the main PCT, I find myself in an alpine meadow. There is a glacial stream flowing through it, with the tastiest water I’ve had on trail. I take a brief nap in the shade of the conifers, before pressing on. The trail is descending through patchy snow, and at some point I realize that the rough path I am following is probably not a trail. I pull out my Halfmile app only to see that I am an entire mile off the alternate! I try walking in the direction of the trail, but am impatient, not bothering to check the land profile. I climb up a steep ridge, squeeze between two giant boulders, and then have to bushwhack through some spiky bushes before I am finally back on the alternate. About five minutes later, I rejoin the main trail. It's taken me an hour to hike one mile…

    My frustration quickly fades as I hike Fuller Ridge, treated to massive views in all directions. It's starting to get later in the afternoon, and I am totally out of water. There is a seasonal creek up ahead, but the last update on the water report says that it's just a small trickle. The stream is a bit off trail, but someone has made little stick arrows pointing the way. There is still some water flowing, meaning I won't have to night hike to the next water source. Shortly after, the trail emerges onto an open face of San Jacinto. I hike for another three miles, before I find a flat spot with an epic view. The peak of San Jacinto is looming behind me, and the desert floor is spread before me. I make some backpacker’s pantry – a trade I made with Jordan for some Idahoan instant mash. Having this spot all to myself is sweet, I’m experiencing that good kind of loneliness that I have come to really appreciate over my first two weeks on trail. It's only 8:15, but I go to lie down in my tent. Only a couple of minutes later, I am out. When I regain consciousness, the stars are twinkling above me. I close my eyes - there are still a few hours before the sun pushes me further in my journey.
